We are not going to be super uptight, and in fact, we do want you to mess around and experiment with the space, so please don't feel constrained. But with that being said, we do have the following norms and guidelines we want everyone to follow:","1. You will keep the door closed and locked if no one is in the room. If you are the last one to leave, please make sure the door is shut and locked behind you. This will help prevent theft. In my experience, UIUC students don't steal things but sometimes non-students enter Siebel so we need to keep the door locked to be safe.","2. We keep screws and cables and items out in the open to make them easy to access. Please help us by putting things back where you found them when you are done. This will help other people find things when they need them.","3. If you find out we are short on any items please let us know right away. This will help us replenish as fast as possible. Also, if you have spare items at the end of the semester feel free to donate them to us by leaving them in 1129!","4. You'll be careful with equipment, and avoid accidentally damaging other studentsâ€™ projects.","5. You are allowed to bring friends and colleagues into the lab but try to make sure they're careful and follow these rules too."]}),o.createElement(u.ns,null)),o.createElement(c.Z,null))}},3360:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"static/hero2-9e8c4ca45b04457e008fbb66a91a893e.jpeg"},1981:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"static/texture-1c89b03b9d49eff824388baab1ecffff.jpeg"}}]);
