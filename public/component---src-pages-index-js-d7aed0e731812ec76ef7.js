Our experts in systems, networking, artificial intelligence, and data sciences coming together are developing algorithms, platforms, and methodologies that provide new ways to collect and digest data at scale, leveraging artificially intelligent network and device infrastructures. To cultivate innovation, we are establishing an IoT Makerspace. Here, students get a chance to explore the ins and outs of IoT through hands-on experience.
