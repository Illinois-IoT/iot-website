Throughout the week, they will be working on a culminating project, where they will apply the concepts being taught in a hands-on environment. There will also be guest speakers from the university and within the industry to give talks on their field of expertise.</p>\n          <p>Campers will also get a feel for college life by living in a campus dorm for the duration of the camp.

WYSE is experienced in organizing events for K-12 students, including sleep-over camps during the summer. While WYSE will facilitate all of the legal logistics of the camp, Illinois IoT is focused on providing the richest educational experience for the campers. Lessons will be taught by college students experienced in the field, under the guidance and instruction of Professor Caesar. The professor and knowledgeable students will also guide the campers through hands-on activities and the week-long project. WYSE counselors will be present in the dorms and during fun activities to oversee the safety and security of all campers.</p>\n          <p>At the end of the week, campers will be able to...
