Our goal is to explore mmWave and its potential applications, working with the sensor hardware, writing firmware, performing data analysis and applying machine learning, and deploying these devices in various fields. We are currently in the research stage, learning what can be done with the technology, studying datasets, and beginning to write firmware to interface with the sensor. With a dedicated team of students experienced in a variety of disciplines, we hope to make significant contributions to the world of IoT."]})),i.createElement(s.Z,null))}},2225:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"static/hero-838d72836236a5bb1d9baf15374b9532.jpg"}}]);
