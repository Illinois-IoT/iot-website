Our mission is to build platforms with strong and rigorous guarantees, with high performance and service quality, that are practically useful and remain resilient in the face of adversaries and unreliable conditions, and that serve to meet societal and ethical principles while advancing equality and viability of our society.\",\n                ]}/>\n      </div>\n      <Footer />\n    </body>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MissionPage\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/hero-838d72836236a5bb1d9baf15374b9532.jpg\";"],"names":["React","Helmet","title","meta","name","content","link","rel","type","href","favicon","Navigation","className","style","display","flexDirection","alignItems","width","padding","SubPageHero","hero_img","hero","subtitle","Paragraph","heading","subheading","paragraphs","Footer"],"sourceRoot":""}
